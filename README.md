# "Angular2-Services-Demo" 
### This repository is a working example of how to set-up Angular 2 Services to access data via WebAPIs. There is a zipcode resolving WebAPI used in the example which will need an account set up at www.zipcodeapi.com to work properly. There is also a post WebAPI endpoint which is also free(like zipcodeapi.com) and which requires not set-up and should work as is without need for any change in repository code.
## The contents of this repository will not work until the command npm install is run from the directory.
